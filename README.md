- If this repo gave you even a tiny smidge of joy or help, hit it with a shiny star ⭐! 

- This repository contains all the important data structures and algorithms that I use in Competitive Programming. 

- I have ```cis_pie``` as my username on all coding platforms. You can view me on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/cis_pie) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/cis_pie).  

- Feel free to use these codes and let me know if you find any bug.

- [Java template for Competitive Programming](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/Main.java)











 
## Fast IO for JAVA : [Template](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/Main.java).
 - Taken this template from legendary coder 
 [uwi](https://codeforces.com/profile/uwi)
 - Java is a little bit slower than C++/C and the main factor behind this is slow console input/output.

- Java's Scanner, as well as BufferedReader class, is too slow. So the best option is creating your own input-output classes.

- I had never faced Time Limit Exceed Error (i.e  Code  takes too much time because of an inefficient/wrong algorithm ) after I started using this template. 


- To use this template you have to write all your code in solve() method.

- From main() method we are calling solve() method which is supposed to solve the asked problem.


## Documentation of methods from this template :

 - **INPUT METHODS**

      - ```int x=ni()``` -to input single number  Short form of nextInt()

      - ```long x=nl() ```  -to input long number nextLong()

      - ```double x=nd()``` - to input double values nextDouble()

      - ```String x=ns()``` - to input string nextString()

      - ```char x=nc()``` - to input character  nextChar()

      - ```int[] arr=na(int n)```  -to input array of size n i.e parameter is integer with  value n. It will allocate a new array and return its reference. nextArray()

      - ```char [][] matrix =nm(int n,int m)``` this is method is used tor inputing character matrix nextMatrix()
      - Refer [this](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Competitive-Programming-in-Java/issues/1) for inputs which are EOF terminated. 

 

- **OUTPUT METHODS**

  - ```pn(Object o)``` - method is used to print anthing on console the parameter is Object is you can pass anthing. It is similar as ```System.out.println()```.
                              
  - ```p(Object o)```- Similar as ```System.out.print()```

- **UTILITY FUNCTIONS**

  - ```int x=max( int[] arr)```  -it will find max element from array.

  - ```int y=min(int [] arr)``` it will find min element from array.

  - ```int g=gcd(x,y)``` for finding gcd.

  - Implemented pair class because there is no inbuilt pair class.
      You can use the pair in Hashed Collections as well as Tree Collections because ```hashCode()``` and ```compareTo()``` methods are implemented in this pair class.
