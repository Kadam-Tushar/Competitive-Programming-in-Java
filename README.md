# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java
All the important data structures and algorithms that I use in Competitive Programming 
I had not followed Object-oriented paradigm for implementing this DS and Algorithms because these codes are primarily used by me in Competitive programming where instead of code compatibility implementation time matters most. That's why I had tried to decrease code length in these implementations.
Feel free to use these codes and if you find anything wrong then don't forget to report me.
