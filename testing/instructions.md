### This **stress testing** technique is adapted from Errichto's [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM).

``gen.java`` : Your test case generator should be wrriten here.

``stupid.java`` : This brute force solution of problem but its correct.

``Main.java`` : Your actual solution which you want to test.

``s.sh`` : This script will run ``gen.java`` which will produce input and then this input will given to  ``stupid.java`` and ``Main.java`` and difference between outputs generated by these programs are compared using ``diff`` command.


``gen.java`` contains some cool methods for generating trees like line graph or binary tree or some small trees

I will try to update more generators for graphs or special numbers as I will get time.
